## High-Performance Computing Workshops
##### [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/)

### Foreword

This workshop series will introduce you to basic concepts in High-Performance Computing.  If you need to use a cluster, this is a great way to get up to speed on how things work and why.

Any Unix-based machine has everything we need for the workshop. If you plan to use your personal laptop that runs Windows, you should install a terminal emulator, such as [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).


### Location

All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, [L416](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210PLANB.html) [Digital Computer Laboratory](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210.html).

**There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!**

L520 DCL can be a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before. It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.
